# Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Rust Code of
Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude. Respect that
people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation
choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. Please keep unstructured
critique to a minimum.

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
