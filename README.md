# net-tools-rs

Rust implementation of [net-tools](https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-tools/).

The status of implemented commands is tracked in
https://github.com/rust-swifties/net-tools-rs/issues/3

## Testing

Compliance tests verify that net-tools-rs commands behave identically to the original
net-tools implementation. See [compliance-tests/README.md](compliance-tests/README.md) for
details on running the tests.
